# EXPLANATION :


# The cash is 200 because in the master_card.withdraw(100) = 100 and the visa.withdraw(100) gives the same 100

# this is because they did not meet the condition in the conditional statements in the method method

# In the child class called MasterCard and Visa,  default values (provider, transaction_fee values) were passed up to parent.

# the balance is 1799.0  is because

# master_card.balance ---- 899.0 ---> because 1000 (passed to Mastercard class) -  101.0 (amount + fee) in the withdraw method
# In the Visa class, the method called withdrawal was overwritten from the one inherited from the parent class CreditCard.
# visa.balance --- 900 ----> because  1000 - 100( from the method of Visa class - 100(passed to withdraw method of Visa class))

# That is the reason for the result

# REASON FOR RESULT

# The first result 50 is gotten from 

# petrol_car = PetrolCar(10, 50) and print(petrol_car.ride(550))
# The child class Petrol class passed up the comsumption and the fuel
# In the parent method the ride returns Kms_left which is gotten from
#        required_fuel = 550 * (10/ 100)
#        kms_left = km - (50 / required_fuel) * 550
# That resulted in 50.0

# Second result = 0

# Reason is that the method ride has be overridded by the class 
# PetrolElectricHybridCar()
# and it goes like 
#        kms_left_with_petrol = super().ride(km)
#        kms_left = max(kms_left_with_petrol - self.kms_with_electric_engine, 0)
#        return kms_left
#   the super().ride(km) inherits the initial ride method created in the parent class.. so that resulted in
#  required_fuel = 550 * (10/ 100)
#  kms_left = km - (50 / required_fuel) * 550 = 50
# then self.fuel = max(self.fuel - 550 * (10/ 100), 0) == the maximum from -5 and 0 = 0
# so the class hybridclass returns 0 which is the km_left{kms_left === max(kms_left_with_petrol - self.kms_with_electric_engine, 0)} = 
#  max(0 - 100, 0)} = which gives 0 as the max number here
